scala-sbt.g8
============

A [Giter8](https://github.com/n8han/giter8) template that creates a [sbt](https://github.com/sbt/sbt) project with support for Scala and ScalaTest.


Usage
=====
After installing [Giter8](https://github.com/n8han/giter8), type:

```bash
$ g8 rlazoti/scala-sbt.g8
```

Note that the '.g8' suffix is implicit so you could also do:

```bash
$ g8 rlazoti/scala-sbt
```

You'll now be prompted for some parameters, just hit "Enter" for default values or type something.

Once everything is okay, type:

```bash
$ cd <your newly created folder>
$ sbt
```


It's done! :)
